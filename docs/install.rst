Installation
============

If you want to check the most up to date beta version, please get the
development branch source code, clone our repository to your local git, or
even install it from pip, as follows:

    ~ $ pip install git+https://github.com/pyttamaster/pytta@development

To install the last version compiled to pip, which at this point may not be
the best version on the repository, do:

    ~ $ pip install pytta
